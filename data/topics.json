If the map features are not fully drawn, the click to identify (or other) function(s) may not work very well.<\/p><p>The search by parcels and search by road name can take a long time to run and it is difficult to know when it is taking awhile vs. when it is no longer trying. The Geocoder widget (in the upper left portion of the map) usually works better but it requires a specific address to find a specific location.
